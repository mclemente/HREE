 hre_reforms.4.t: "Common Penny"
 hre_reforms.4.d: "The Common Penny was an imperial tax that was agreed at the instigation of Maximilian I in 1495 at the Diet of Worms, in order to give the emperor the means to wage war against France and against the Ottoman Empire.\nPassing this reform will give the following:\n*Members will be prompted to pay a tax to the [HLR.GetName]'s Common Penny Fund, which may help him against external enemies on future wars\n(the Emperor won't get any bonus, unless at war with foreign enemies)."
 hre_reforms.5.t: "Imperial Circles"
 hre_reforms.5.d: "An Imperial Circle comprised a regional grouping of territories of the Holy Roman Empire, primarily for the purpose of organizing a common defensive structure and of collecting the imperial taxes, but also as a means of organization within the Imperial Diet and the Imperial Chamber Court.

 hre_reforms.11.t: "The Votes for Reform Fail"
